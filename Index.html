            <h2>About me</h2>
      <img src="/images/hi 2.jpg" alt="Totally my bust" style="width:128px;height:128px;">
          <p>My full name is Weston Joseph Andew Pineiro, and I am 15 years old. In the summer of 2015, I started attending BizSteam Academy after my school year at West Michigan Aviation Academy. I enjoy coding very much, though I am not very good at it. My life consites of PC gaming for the most part. Games that I like playing include World of Tanks, Minecraft, Garry's Mod, Call of Duty: World at War, etc. I always play these games with my good friends online, and we talk through Skype. I also have a tabby cat named Callisto who tends to be outside for hours at a time and then come inside, meow, eat food, and then go back outside. Also, I tend to procrastinate things that I need to do (including this project) and not get things done. That's why I perfer to just play video games.</p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>My skills include HTML layout, CSS, basic JavaScript and JQuery. I plan to learn more things, like Python, Ruby, C#, C++, etc, etc. I also know a lot about the anatomy of computers and pretty much know how they work. I can diagnose problems with hardware and determine a good plan to optimize performance.</p>
      
      <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>The kind of experience I have includes, obviously, a lot to do with computers. I have dissected some computers in my time and I am able to identify pretty much every part of one and can put one together for the most part. I still need to practice. I also have tested various different games in the early stages of test phases, so I have experience in testing for bugs and glitches and reporting them (on forums).</p>
